# Email Bot With Voice Input
This project aims to save the time that is needed to type and send the mail, simply by automating it and furthermore taking voice input from the sender.

This is a python project where in with the help of libraries such as text to speech and speech recognition, the program asks the user to input his desired email subject and email content and send it to a particular user, all with a voice command. The user can create short words or phrases which can help the program under to who do you want to send the mail to. Once, the sent command is given, the program sends an email with voice input.
